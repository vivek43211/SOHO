# 📡 Project 1: Design and Implementation of a Small Office Home Office Network (SOHO)

## 📝 Case Study and Requirements

XYZ Company is a fast-growing enterprise based in Eastern Australia, serving over 2 million customers globally. The company specializes in buying and selling food products, with operations centralized at its headquarters.

To expand operations, XYZ Company plans to open a branch near the local village of **Bonalbo**. This branch will operate **independently** from the headquarters' network. As a result, the company has assigned the task of designing the network to a young IT graduate.

### 📋 Requirements:

- One router and one switch to be used (All **CISCO** devices)
- Three departments:
  - **Admin/IT**
  - **Finance/HR**
  - **Customer Service/Reception**
- Each department must be assigned a **different VLAN**
- Each department should have its own **wireless network**
- All host devices must receive **IPv4 addresses automatically** (via DHCP)
- All devices across departments should be able to **communicate**
- The base network assigned by the ISP: `192.168.1.0/24`

## 🎯 Objective

To design and implement a secure, efficient, and scalable SOHO network infrastructure for the new branch of XYZ Company, using Cisco devices, while meeting all given technical and business requirements.

## 🔧 Technologies & Configurations Implemented

- ✅ Created a basic network using a **Cisco Router** and **Access Layer Switch**
- ✅ Connected networking devices using appropriate **cabling**
- ✅ Configured **VLANs** and assigned VLAN IDs to switch ports
- ✅ Performed **Subnetting and IP addressing** for efficient allocation
- ✅ Configured **Inter-VLAN Routing** using **Router-on-a-Stick**
- ✅ Set up the **DHCP Server** on the router to assign IPs dynamically
- ✅ Configured **Wireless Access Points** for departmental Wi-Fi
- ✅ Applied **Host Device Configurations** for all end devices
- ✅ **Tested and Verified** network connectivity across VLANs

## 📌 Outcome

This project reinforced practical knowledge in:

- Enterprise-level **LAN design**
- **VLAN segmentation** and logical separation
- **Dynamic IP address allocation**
- Real-world application of **Cisco routing and switching concepts**
- End-to-end **network connectivity validation**
